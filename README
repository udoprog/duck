duck
----

A minimalist installer system generator.

about
-----

Duck will help you generate installer system images setup as an initrd, similar
to how debian-installer works.

There are however a few goals with duck that are different.

* No memory restrictions (debian-installer is geared towards 32M)
* Less rigorous space restrictions
  - No special packaging necessary, but encouraged: http://www.emdebian.org/
  - No library stripping.

All in all, you get a slightly bigger installer image, but a lot more
flexibility.

usage
-----

Duck has two steps in creating an initrd.

setup - Setup base configuration.

build - Build the base system.
pack - Pack the resulting initrd.img

For testing/tweaking there are two other commands available.

enter - Enter the chroot that is used to build the initrd.
qemu - Run the resulting initrd in a qemu-based virtual environment.
